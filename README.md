# pole-time-viewer
The Pole Time Viewer is a work in progress tool that intends to give users the ability to quickly search for the pole time at a certain track, in any series around
the world.

We have opted not to use an API for this, as the intention is that it's a kind of independent operation - it's against the spirit of the project to take the cheap
route.  With that being said, there are many changes that we intend to make.  For example, I am trying to find a way to implement some form of SQL database, that can
be edited easily - without having to edit the HTML table each time.  Until then, at least it is functional.
